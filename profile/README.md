# Stacklyn
Stacklyn is a JavaScript tool meant to simplify stack trace handling (and maybe other stuff 👀)  
You can check out the [documentation](https://stacklyn.github.io/docs) or [repo](https://github.com/stacklynjs/stacklyn) to know more about us :3  

Fun Fact: Stacklyn aims to support every JS environment out there... even including your smart toaster, maybe... 🍞
